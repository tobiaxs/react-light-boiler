Lightweight, easy to set up and customisable React boilerplate.
Things that you don't have to take care about include Docker, ESLint, Prettier, Husky, Jest, CI.

That might not be the biggest React boiler you have ever seen,
but it's just meant to be comprehensive and easy to use.

## Getting started

The local setup is made with docker-compose.

Building the images

```shell
docker-compose build
```

Running the containers

```shell
docker-compose up
```
